The code calculates how many astronauts can fit inside a spacecraft based on its dimensions and the average height of the astronauts. If the number is between 3 and 10, 
it prints how many astronauts the spacecraft can hold. If it's less than 3, the spacecraft is too small, and if it's more than 10, it's too big.
